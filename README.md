This is a [giter8](https://github.com/n8han/giter8) template for removing
the boilerplate in setting up a new SBT multi-project definition:

* SBT 0.12.1 and Scala 2.9.2
* Default "all" aggregate project and a "core" sub project
* `main` and `test` source directories and stubs
* [specs2](http://etorreborre.github.com/specs2/)
* project `name`, `organization` and `version` customizable as variables (Novus defaults)
* everything in your project's base package imported automatically in repl sessions
